        Cascading Style Sheet or CSS is a style sheet language, which defines how an HTML page should be presented. <br>
        It basically styles the presentation of a particular piece of markup language code. <br>
         There are three ways to include CSS in any HTML code, which are, External, Internal and Inline. <br>
         While we call the externally defined style sheet in our page in the External method, we define the style within in the same HTML code <br>
         in the Internal method. It uses style attributes for styling elements. Internal CSS is included in the same HTML page, as it is used for styling the elements being used in the code
